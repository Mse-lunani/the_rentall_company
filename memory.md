tenants (1) ←→ (many) payments ←→ (1) tenants_units  
units (many) ←→ (1) buildings ←→ (1) owners
```

### Frontend Structure
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/dashboard/*` - Full system management
- **Owner Dashboard**: `/owner_dashboard/*` - Owner-specific views
- **Authentication**: Separate login flows for admin vs owner

### Recent Fixes & Updates
- **Improved Payment API for Multiple Tenancies:** Updated the `/api/payments` endpoint to handle cases where a tenant has multiple active tenancies. The API now requires a specific tenancy to be selected if a tenant has more than one active tenancy, preventing payments from being mis-assigned.
- **Fixed Owner Payments API:** Corrected the query in `/api/owner/payments` to properly join through the `tenants_units` table, ensuring accurate payment records for owners, especially for tenants with multiple tenancies.
- **Fixed Duplicate Tenants:** Updated the `/api/tenants` endpoint to return unique tenants, resolving an issue where tenants with multiple active tenancies would appear multiple times in tenant lists.
- Fixed all legacy `tenants.unit_id` references (30+ database queries)
- Updated frontend components to match new API responses
- Cleaned up status badges and field mappings
- Fixed chart border radius issues
- Improved error handling in login (server errors)
- Added cron job testing (3-minute intervals)

### Owner Dashboard Alignment (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Complete API Alignment:** Updated all owner dashboard components to use `/api/owner/*` endpoints instead of main `/api/*` endpoints
- **Navigation Updates:** Fixed all navigation links to use `/owner_dashboard/*` paths instead of `/dashboard/*`
- **Authentication System:** Created complete owner login/logout flow with session management
- **Component Updates:** Updated 15+ dashboard components including:
  - Payment forms and pages - now use `/api/owner/payments`
  - Tenant forms and tables - now use `/api/owner/tenants`
  - Property management - already using `/api/owner/property-records`
  - KPI dashboard - already using `/api/owner/kpis`
  - Sidebar navigation - added tenant assignment link and proper logout
- **Security Verification:** All owner endpoints properly filter by `owner_id` for data isolation
- **Feature Parity:** Owner dashboard now has same functionality as admin dashboard (except owner creation)
- **Testing Completed:** Verified with curl tests - all APIs return owner-specific data correctly

### Owner Dashboard Form Security Enhancement (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Multiple Submission Prevention:** Updated all forms in owner dashboard to prevent multiple submissions
- **Forms Updated:**
  - Payment forms (add & edit) - Added/improved `isSubmitting` state
  - Tenant forms (add, edit, move, assignment) - Enhanced submission protection
  - Property forms (entry, building edit, unit edit) - Added submission prevention
  - Profile forms (profile & password) - Added submission states with simulated API calls
  - Maintenance forms (add) - Added submission prevention
- **Implementation Pattern:** Consistent `isSubmitting` state with disabled buttons and loading text
- **Error Handling:** Forms re-enable on API errors for proper user experience
- **User Experience:** Clear visual feedback during form processing
- **Security Benefit:** Prevents duplicate data creation and API abuse from rapid clicking

### Owner Dashboard Tenant Management Optimization (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Tenant Listing Filtering:** Modified `/api/owner/tenants` to show only tenants with active tenancies
  - Changed from LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN on `tenants_units` table
  - Always requires `occupancy_status = 'active'` for all tenant listings
  - Ensures owners only see tenants currently assigned to their properties
- **Removed Legacy Tenant Add Form:** Deleted `/owner_dashboard/tenants/add/` directory
  - Removed duplicate functionality in favor of unified tenant assignment system
  - Updated sidebar navigation to remove "Add Tenant" link
- **Enhanced Tenant Edit Form:** Complete overhaul of tenant editing capabilities
  - **Removed Unit Selection:** No longer allows changing unit assignments from edit form
  - **Added Password Management:** Integrated password regeneration functionality
    - Shows current password in monospace display
    - "Regenerate" button creates new 4-digit password (1000-9999)
    - Updates both hashed and plain text passwords in database
    - Provides immediate feedback with new password
  - **Focused Interface:** Only allows editing basic tenant information (name, phone, email)
  - **API Enhancement:** Added PATCH method to `/api/owner/tenants` for password operations
  - **Owner Security:** All operations verify tenant ownership through unit relationships

- **Session management** with `tenant_session` HTTP-only cookies
- **Security isolation** - tenants only see their own data via tenant ID filtering

#### Payment Calculation System

- **Pro-rated Rent Calculation**:
  ```
  Formula: (days_from_start_to_next_month / total_days_in_month) × monthly_rent
  Example: Sept 13 start → 18 days to Oct 1 → (18/30) × 20,000 = 11,333.33
  ```

- **Monthly Payments**: Regular rent due 5th of each month thereafter
- **Overdue Tracking**: Immediate overdue status if first payment not made on move-in
- **Pro-rated Calculations**: Accurate daily calculations for partial months

#### Technical Highlights
- **Duplicate Phone Prevention**: Updated database to ensure unique tenant phone numbers
- **Date Handling**: Proper timezone and date calculations for payment due dates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with loading and refresh options
- **Performance**: Optimized queries joining tenancies, units, buildings, and payments

### Data Quality Notes
- **Building Ownership**: Some buildings have `NULL` owner_id which may cause incomplete filtering in owner APIs
- **Recommendation**: Set proper owner_id for all buildings OR add unit-level owner_id for standalone units
- **Tenant Phone Numbers**: Updated to ensure uniqueness across all tenant records
