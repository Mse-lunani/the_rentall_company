# Next Steps: Owner and Tenant Dashboard Implementation

## Current System Analysis (Completed by Agent)

### Key Findings:

- **Database Ready**: All necessary tables exist (owners, tenants, buildings, units, payments, maintenance_logs)
- **Authentication Foundation**: Owners and tenants already have password fields
- **Reusable Components**: Current admin dashboard components can be adapted
- **Strong Architecture**: Well-structured codebase ready for multi-role expansion

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)**

1. **Enhance authentication system for multi-role login (admin/owner/tenant)**
2. **Create folder structure for owner and tenant dashboards**
3. **Build enhanced login API with role detection**

### **Phase 2: Owner Dashboard (Medium Priority)**

4. **Create owner dashboard layout and basic components**
5. **Implement owner-specific KPIs and main dashboard**
6. **Build owner properties view (filtered by ownership)**
7. **Create owner tenants view (their tenants only)**
8. **Implement owner payments tracking**
9. **Build owner maintenance requests view**

### **Phase 3: Tenant Dashboard (Medium Priority)**

10. **Create tenant dashboard layout and basic components**
11. **Create tenant main dashboard with unit information**
12. **Implement tenant payment history view**
13. **Build tenant maintenance request system**

### **Phase 4: API & Testing (High Priority)**

14. **Create role-specific API endpoints for data access**
15. **Test authentication flows and role-based access control**

## Recommended Folder Structure

```
src/app/(dashboard)/
├── admin/                  # Current admin dashboard (renamed)
├── owner_dashboard/                  # New owner dashboard
│   ├── layout.jsx
│   ├── page.jsx           # Owner main dashboard
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── OwnerSidebar.jsx
│   │   └── OwnerNavbar.jsx
│   ├── properties/        # Owner's properties view
│   ├── tenants/          # Owner's tenants view
│   ├── payments/         # Owner's payments view
│   └── maintenance/      # Owner's maintenance view
├── tenant_dashboard/               # New tenant dashboard
│   ├── layout.jsx
│   ├── page.jsx          # Tenant main dashboard
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── TenantSidebar.jsx
│   │   └── TenantNavbar.jsx
│   ├── unit/            # Unit information
│   ├── payments/        # Payment history
│   └── maintenance/     # Maintenance requests
└── components/          # Shared components (enhanced for roles)
```

## Key Features by Role

### **Owner Dashboard Features:**

- View their own properties (buildings and units)
- Monitor tenants in their properties
- Track payments for their units
- Review maintenance requests for their properties
- View property-specific analytics

### **Tenant Dashboard Features:**

- View current unit details and lease information
- View payment history and due dates
- Submit and track maintenance requests
- Access tenant-specific documents and information

## Technical Considerations

### **Security Measures:**

- Server-side data filtering based on authenticated user role
- Input validation for all role-specific operations
- Session-based authentication with role verification
- API endpoint protection with role-based middleware

### **Data Access Permissions:**

**Owner Permissions:**

- Read: Own buildings, units, tenants in their properties, payments for their units
- Write: Limited maintenance updates, property information updates
- No Access: Other owners' data, admin functions, global settings

**Tenant Permissions:**

- Read: Own unit info, own payments, own maintenance requests
- Write: Create maintenance requests, update own contact info
- No Access: Other tenants' data, property management, financial summaries

## Ready to Start Implementation

To begin implementation, start with **Phase 1, Task 1**: Enhancing the authentication system for multi-role login. This will be the foundation for all other dashboard functionality.
